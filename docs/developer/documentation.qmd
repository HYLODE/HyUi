# Project documentation

Set up for editing and building documentation
All based around Quarto
Documentation in ./docs

- installed basic python and jupyter extensions necessary including those for jupyter
- installed [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
- installed the [VSCode extension](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html) 

Workflow

```sh
cd docs
quarto preview
```

Don't forget that changes to config (e.g. `_quarto.yml` may need you to rerun `quarto render` to ensure the whole site is correctly rebuilt)
