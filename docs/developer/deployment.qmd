# Deployment

-
- Configure your `.env` variables using `.env.example` as a template.
- Stand up with Docker Compose. `docker compose --project-name [project name] up --build`. Ensure that you use a project name that does not conflict with others. Our production project name is `hyui-prod`.



## Deployment

### Setup environment

Clone the repository on an NHS server `git clone https://github.com/HYLODE/HyUi.git` and configure your `.env` variables using `.env.example` as a template.

### Build the Docker Compose services.

In the `code` directory:

```sh
docker compose --project-name [project name] build
```

### Run the Docker Compose services

In the `code` directory:

```sh
docker compose --project-name [project name] up
```

### Stop And Remove Docker Containers

```sh
docker compose --project-name [project name] down
```

### An one-liner

Replace _myname_ with anything that won't clash with other users (e.g. _your_ name!)

```shell
docker compose --project-name hyui-dev-myname up --build -d && docker compose -p hyui-dev-myname logs -f
```
