title: Setting up development for HyUi
---

## Architecture

The root directory contains all the libraries that are used to power the HyUi dashboards.

- `api`: This is a FastAPI app that does all the data wrangling and accessing of external sources such as to databases and web services. For each route there should be an equivalent mock route that allows this app to serve mock data when run in development. For example, if there is a `/census/` endpoint then there should be a corresponding `/mock/census` endpoint that only serves mock data.
- `web`: This contains the Plotly Dash web server code. It should *only* communicate with the `api` service. This allows the `api` service to provide mock data seamlessly when developing without needing to spin up other services to help development.
- `models`: This contains all the Pydantic models that are used to share data between the `api` and `web`.
- `initialise`: This sets-up the BaseRow instance that is used for configuration by the user.
- `cache`: This contains the HTTP cache service that serves cached objects from `api` to `web` with a 5 minute expiry. See [the deployment docs](./deployment.qmd) for more information.
- `baserow`: We use [baserow](https://baserow.io) as a temporary database to that allows us to store information about patients without directly editing EMAP or EPIC. It is not relevant when running HyUI on your local machine, as all mock data will be stored locally. However, it is important to understand when [deploying](deployment.qmd) HyUI with live data within the NHS.

### Architecture Ideals
- `web` should only communicate with `api` for data. This allows us to entirely mock data for `web` when developing.
- Communication between `web` and `api` should only be done in a defined way using models described in `models`. `models` is the only shared code between `api` and `web`.
- Pages in `web/src/web/pages` should be independent of each other so there is minimal/no sharing between two sets of pages. Common code can be put in a separate module or package in `web`.


## Local Development

### Install Requirements

- Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- Install [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)


### 1. Clone the HyUi repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HYLODE/HyUi.git
```
### 2. Create Required Virtual Environments

```sh
pyenv virtualenv 3.11.0 hyui-web
pyenv virtualenv 3.11.0 hyui-api
```

<span style="color:red">As of Feb 2023, Python 3.11.0 causes diskcache / SQLalchemy issues with local development on some machines. For now, we recommend changing the above commands to instead use python 3.10.8.</span>


### 3. Activate Virtual Environments

In one shell:

```sh
pyenv activate hyui-web
```

In another shell:
```sh
pyenv activate hyui-api
```

These will be the Python virtual environments that contain all the dependencies for the Dash web app and the API backend.

### 4. Install the Website app requirements

In the `hyui-web` terminal in the root directory:

```sh
pip install -e "models[test]"
pip install -e "web[test]"
```

### 5. Install the API requirements
In the `hyui-api` terminal in the root directory:

```sh
pip install -e "models[test]"
pip install -e "api[test]"
```

### 6. Install the pre-commit Hooks

In your shell (`hyui-api` or `hyui-web`) run the following command:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

### 6. Configure Environment Variables

You will need to create and configure a `.env` file in your directory root.

An example environment variable file can be found at `.env.example`. The environment variables for each app are documented in the Pydantic Settings classes in `web/src/web/config.py` and `api/src/api/config.py`. An important one for development and production is the `WEB_API_URL` variable. This should be set to the host and port of your `api` server so most likely something like `http://api:8000` for running in Docker or `http://localhost:[port]/mock` for development. The `port` needs to line up with that specified when starting the FastAPI server below (we have used `8092` throughout these docs).

Note that in development a `/mock` path has been added. This allows the Dash web app to use all the mock endpoints instead of the live endpoints.

The environment variables are _required_, and the application will fail if any of these are missing when it attempts to run.

### 7. Running The Servers Manually When Developing

The web server when in the `hyui-web` shell:

```sh
env $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs) python -m web.app
```

The API server when in the `hyui-api` shell:

```sh
env $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs) uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8092
```

Ensure you replace `.env` with the correct path to your development `.env` file. The command `env $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)` loads the contents of the `.env` into the environment just for the current execution. The `grep -v '^#'` part excludes lines beginning with a `#` in the env file.

The `--port` specified in the `hyui-api` command should match the port in the `WEB_API_URL` variable of your `.env`ironment.

You can run both these commands from within vscode or pycharm - see instructions [here](ide_setup.qmd).

#### Debugging On Your Local Machine

## Initialisation

Currently only Baserow needs to be initialised by creating an admin user and setting up the tables required for the rest of the app to function correct. The `initialise` python package contains the code that does all this.

```sh
pyenv virtualenv 3.11.0 hyui-initialise
pyenv activate hyui-initialise

pip install -e "initialise"

python -m initialise.main --operation baserow
```

You can do this on your local machine but you need to install (with docker).
See the [docs](https://baserow.io/docs/installation%2Finstall-with-docker).
If you do this then don't forget to adjust the `BASEROW_PUBLIC_URL` to point to your local dev version (e.g. `http://localhost:80`) -->
