## Notes on setting up PyCharm for development with specific reference to working on a Mac

Set up run configurations

- https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/run-debug-configuration.html
- install the **EnvFile** plug-in so that the environment file can be read by your run configuration (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/42708476/992999)
- set `OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES` as an environment variable in your run configuration to avoid [errors](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52230415/992999) on recent _macos_ installs

Example configurations here
- [FastAPI](../snippets/HyUI-API%20FastAPI.run.xml)
- [Plotly Dash](../snippets/HyUI-Web%20Plotly%20Dash.run.xml)


## Notes on setting up VSCode for development

Because there are separate Python packages with separate interpreters you will need a ['multiroot' workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces). I found this [note](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56080307/different-python-version-environment-per-directory-in-vscode) from StackOverFlow helpful.

One small problem with sharing a VS Code configuration is that it seems to require absolute paths from the `settings.json` and `launch.json` files. With that caveat in mind, then here are some examples below.

1. Git clone the project as per usual
2. Open the project in VSCode and save as a workspace
3. Edit the root (HyUI) `.vscode/settings.json` file to exclude the folders holding the nested packages

```json
{
    "files.exclude": {
        "**/.git": true,
        "**/.svn": true,
        "**/.hg": true,
        "**/CVS": true,
        "**/.DS_Store": true,
        "**/Thumbs.db": true,
        // exclude nested modules/packages below
        "api": true,
        "web": true,
        "initialise": true,
        "jupyter": true,
    }
}
```

4. Add these folders back in via **Workspaces >> Add folder to workspace ...** command (nested under the File menu). In my case, this means that my 'workspace' file, now looks like this (where I have used the `name` property to help me visually navigate my workspace).

```json
{
	"folders": [
		{
			"path": ".",
			"name": "HyUi Project"
		},
		{
			"path": "api",
			"name": "HyUi FastAPI"
		},
		{
			"path": "web",
			"name": "HyUi Plotly Dash"
		}
	]
}
```

And my sidebar in VS Code (with the `web` labelled as 'HyUI Plotly Dash')

5. Then prepare nested `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/launch.json` files etc (also visible in the screenshot above). For example, for the `web` module, you need to specify the interpreter, and a debug configuration (in `launch.json`)

Beware the absolute paths below â˜¹. You will need to change these unless your name is also 'steve'.

`settings.json`

```json
{
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${userHome}/.pyenv/hyui-web/bin/python3",
    "python.envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env",
    "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
        "src/web/"
    ],
    "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
    "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true
}
```

`launch.json`

```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "HyUi: Plotly Dash",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "module": "web.app",
            "args": [],
            "jinja": true,
            "justMyCode": true,
            "python": "/users/steve/.pyenv/versions/hyui-web/bin/python3",
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/src",
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/../.env",
            "env": {
                "OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY": "YES",
                "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1",
        }
        }
    ]
}
```
