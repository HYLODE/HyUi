# `hyui`

User interface for the HYLODE project[This project structure is based on the
`govcookiecutter` template project][govcookiecutter] but is adapted to work
with applications rather than just data science workflows. A template
application would be split into a frontend and a backend with communication
between the two via HTTP, and the project orchestrated by docker-compose.

## Frontend vs Backend


## Project structure
