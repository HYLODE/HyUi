# Model Card: PACU Bed Requirement

This page uses an experimental machine learning model to predict whether or not a patient will require admission to an Intensive Care Unit after their operation.

It is has not been tested nor validated and so should _not_ be used to guide clinical practice.

Currently, you can alter the cut-offs for when the model flags patients by moving the slider below.
The model will flag patients who are not booked for PACU but have **high** predicted probability of ICU admission by adding a ‚ö†Ô∏è flag to the PACU column. If a patient has a PACU bed booked but the predicted probability of ICU admission is **low**, the model will add a ü§∑ symbol.

The **"high"** and **"low"** cut offs can be adjusted by moving the slider below.

We are keen to collect feedback on the performance of this model. Please contact our team at [h.vaidya@nhs.net](mailto:h.vaidya@nhs.net) to get involved.
