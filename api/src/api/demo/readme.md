- Example of how to create a new endpoint.
- Create a new 'python package' (directory containing an `__init__.py`) file under `api/src/api/`.
- Create a `router.py` file within this package
- Generate some fake/mock data ideally by hand. You might want to run the SQL script you're planning to use, then copy the column headings into an excel file, and then create a couple of rows of fake data that you could/should save as a Python List of dictionaries or similar. You need to make this data available to your 'mock' endpoint.
- create a mock and a non-mock endpoint in `router.py`
- register these endpoints in `api/src/api/main.py`
- test!
